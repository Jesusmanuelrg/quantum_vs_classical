# Data Analysis: Quantum Vs Classical Computing

As mentioned before, we are going to compare two machines performing a classification task, the algorithm that we will put to the test is called SVC (Support Vector Classifier), which is an implementation of an SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification tasks.
